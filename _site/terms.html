    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, including but not limited to the restriction of access to your computer and/or account. You agree to accept responsibility for any and all activities or actions that occur under your account and/or password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders in our sole discretion.</p>
    <h3>Links To Other Web Sites</h3>
    <p>Our Service may contain links to third party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by TINGR LLC.</p>
    <p>TINGR LLC. has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. We do not warrant the offerings of any of these entities/individuals or their websites.</p>

    <p>If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.</p>
    <p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>
    <h3>Indemnification</h3>
    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless TINGR LLC. and its licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of a) your use and access of the Service, by you or any person using your account and password, or b) a breach of these Terms.</p>
    <h3>Limitation Of Liability</h3>
    <p>In no event shall TINGR LLC., nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>
    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis.

    <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of California, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
    <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.</p>
